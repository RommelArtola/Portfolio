/* Comments, Info, Intro. 
Please note this data is older than current because the source was changed. The data was extracted from the world COVID-19 dataset from link: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

Additionally, the data source was one large .CSV file and then split into two seperate .xslx files; one for COVID deaths, and the other for COVID vaccination info. 

The purpose of this project is to highlight and show some of my skills in SQL for ETL as well as visualizing this data.
